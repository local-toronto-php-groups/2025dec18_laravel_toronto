I am very happy to announce that our next Laravel Toronto meet-up will be at YTZ International, near Spadina/Queen.

We will open up with a brief look at features of the newly released PHP 8.5.

I will then take a look at FrankenPHP. I will attempt to do so using Plain English.

I have a few LaraConUS t-shirts to give away. 

Peter Heslop has generously provided a copy of his new book, "Laravel For The Rest Of Us" to give away.

Schedule:
- 6:00pm to 7:00pm: meet-and-greet
- 7:00pm to 9:00pm: presentation
